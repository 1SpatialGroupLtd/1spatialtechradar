**1Spatial Tech Radar**

The 1Spatial Tech Radar (inspired by the Thoughtworks one) is a snapshot of practices, tools, techniques, platforms, languages and frameworks which we are widely using, trialing or investigating. 

For the Software engineering team this is as an interactive 'conversation starter' for the team to collaborate on putting new tech "on our radar" (pun intended). 

Outside of the Tech Team this is a tool to showcase technologies that we are actively using or looking to trial.

**Contribution**

All 1Spatial team members are encourages to contribute to the repository and the intent is this will be reviewed and updated as a group twice a year.
